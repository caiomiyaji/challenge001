This is an attempt to recreate a design from Frontend Mentor, using only HTML and CSS.

Frontend Mentor Design: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa

The challenge was to build this project making it looks as close to the original one as possible. The background is only white with no shapes, because I didnÂ´t 
find a way to recreate them.
